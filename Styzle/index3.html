    <h3>BAS- GOLDEN GOALS</h3>
    <p class="lyrics"> General guidelines to ride by<br>
        Can't kill my vibe, you couldn't find mine<br>
        Come to New York City, I'm in the skyline with a fine dime<br>
        And nigga we ain't fine dining<br>
        Hit the Halal stand for cheap plates<br>
        Hit the high line, that's a cheap date<br>
        I ain't worthy, fuck it who is?<br>
        Do what you do girl, fuck it you lit<br>
        Hundred niggas yelling "New York back"<br>
        I hear em rapping they only set, "New York back"<br>
        I'm in Queens to Harlem, the Garden I rap<br>
        And I'm only hearing New York clap<br>
        Bout to move out to Cali, got a little thing out the valley<br>
        And this one girl hiding my hookah<br>
        I wish I knew to show her how to maneuver<br>
        Truth, through the city like a presidential motorcade<br>
        On my way so the motherfuckers don't shake<br>
        Never mind I'm just smoking that grade A<br>
        Running with the same niggas since grade eight<br>
        You ain't never seen no strangers appear<br>
        My niggas been the same ones for years<br>
        I don't do it for the peers, I do it for the fam<br>
        Man, all of my angles are clear<br>
        Other day yo, I was shopping on Rodeo<br>
        Got a call from my nigga Cheyo<br>
        Said the hood hot bro<br>
        Gotta get away yo<br>
        Losing niggas like every day<br>
        Told 'em 18 months I'ma get a tour bus<br>
        Coming up and we never looking back<br>
        Need a rut to the cuts that bleeds deep<br>
        Three ducks in the truck like beep beep<br>
        </p>
